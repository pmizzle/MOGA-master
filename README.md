**MOGA controller support for Windows Phone 8.1/Windows 10 (UWP)**

This simple and lightweight library will add "native" support of MOGA Bluetooth game controllers to your app.

Library was tested with good and inexpensive [MOGA Mobile controller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096L2SJ0/?tag=wpcentral00-20&ascsubtag=UUwpUvbUpU3563135); it also should work with the other MOGA game controllers.

You can use Windows 8.1/WP 8.1 builds with your W8.1 UWP or W10 UWP apps and games.

You may check this code on my [DOSBox app](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/dosbox/9nblggh4q6j8) and [D00M game](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/d00лю/9nblggh4rql0)

Enjoy!
